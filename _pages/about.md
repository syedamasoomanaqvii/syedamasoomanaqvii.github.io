I am a PhD. student in Computer Science at the University of Minnesota where I am advised by [Harmanpreet Kaur](https://harmanpk.github.io). I am a part of the [GroupLens Research Lab](https://grouplens.org). I study how humans and AI make decisions together, with a focus on how group composition, experience, and expertise shape that collaboration. My work spans human-centered AI, interpretability, and explainable ML, where I evaluate existing tools and develop theory-driven design paradigms aligned with human cognitive and socio-organizational norms. I aim to offer  frameworks and guidance for responsible, reliable human–AI workflows.
