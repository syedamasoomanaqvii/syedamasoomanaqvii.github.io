I am a PhD. student in Computer Science at the University of Minnesota where I am advised by [Harmanpreet Kaur](https://harmanpk.github.io). I am a part of the [GroupLens Research Lab](https://grouplens.org). My work explores how human-AI teams make decisions, and how factors like group composition and expertise shape these processes. I am also curious about how AI is reshaping human cognition and creativity. Ultimately, my goal is to develop frameworks that support ethical and responsible collaboration between humans and AI systems.
